In the velvety cloak of the infinite night,  
Where stars whisper secrets in gleaming light,  
A symphony played on the strings of the sky,  
A dance of the cosmos, where comets fly.  

Orion's Belt, a gemstone sash so bright,  
Andromeda's spiral, a breathtaking sight,  
The Milky Wayâ€™s river, a silvery band,  
A canvas so vast, so majestically grand.  

Telescopes peer into the depths unseen,  
Revealing wonders, where we've never been.  
Nebulae bloom like flowers in the void,  
Galaxies spiral, in dark matter buoyed.  

Planets in motion, around stars they swing,  
Each with its tales, and secrets to bring.  
Moons with their craters, and rings of ice,  
Celestial bodies in a cosmic splice.  

Black holes, the mysteries, the universe's drains,  
Where time and space undergo cosmic strains.  
Astronomy, the study of night's domain,  
A quest to understand, a knowledge to gain.  

So gaze up above, and you might just find,  
A universe vast, and wonderfully kind.  
For each star above has a story to tell,  
In the grand book of cosmos, where wonders dwell.  

In this endless pursuit, we are but a speck,  
A fleeting moment on the cosmic deck.  
Yet in our hearts, a universe expands,  
As we reach out to the stars with outstretched hands.
